MCMC’s Legislative Obligations  \\nPart VI of the CMA contains provisions on economic regulation including access to services.  \\nSection 149 within Chapter 3, Part VI requires Access Providers to provide access to \\nfacilities and services on reasonab le terms and conditions, which, in the MCMC’s view, \\ninclude the prices that an Access Provider sets.  \\nIn addition to Part VI, section 198 under Chapter 4, Part VIII of the CMA contains \\nprovisions on consumer protection including the following principles on  rate setting:  \\n(a) rates must be fair and, for similarly situated persons, not unreasonably \\ndiscriminatory;  \\n(b) rates should be oriented toward costs and, in general, cross -subsidies should be \\neliminated;  \\n(c) rates should not contain discounts that unreasonably pre judice the competitive \\nopportunities of other providers;  \\n(d) rates should be structured and levels set to attract investment into the \\ncommunications and multimedia industry; and  \\n(e) rates should take account of the regulations and recommendations of the \\ninternat ional organisations of which Malaysia is a member.  \\nAs explained in the PI Paper , the MCMC views that it is required to undertake a Public \\nInquiry under section 55 of the CMA in order to set pri ces for facilities or services i n the \\nAccess List because dete rmination of these prices is very likely to be of significant interest \\nto all sectors of the economy, including providers and potential providers of these services \\nas well as end users  of communications services .  \\nThe MCMC  is now required to make any deter minations arising out of this Public Inquir y \\nno later than  3 March  2023, which is 45 days after the close of public comments on the PI \\nPaper . The MCMC  proposes to issue a new Commission Determination that will reflect the \\nMCMC ’s final views as expressed i n this PI Report in respect of the pricing of some of the \\nfacilities and services in the Access List for the period 20 23 to 2025. \\n1.3.

The MCMC \\nagrees that such a scenario is highly undesirable and unli kely to be in the long -\\nterm interests of end -users. The MCMC intends to monitor markets closely for \\nsuch behaviour and in future will consider pure LRIC as one potential tool to \\naddress these issues.  \\nMCMC’s Final View \\n3.2.29  The MCMC confirms that it will appl y the costing approaches outlined in the PI \\nPaper .  \\n  '),\n",

As the MCMC is setting prices using the LRIC \\napproach rather than an RAB approach the MCMC considers that a pre -tax WACC \\nremains appropriate.  \\n5.2.18  The MCMC also notes that the Commerce Commission itself dre w a distinction \\nbetween the LRIC approach it had previously applied in the 2015 price regulation \\nof unbundled copper local loop and unbundled bitstream services, and the RAB \\napproach, and clearly states that a pre -tax approach was appropriate for its \\nearlier LRIC calculation1.  \\n5.2.19  For these reasons the MCMC believes that it remains appropriate to apply a pre -\\ntax WACC.  \\nMCMC's final view  \\n5.2.20  The MCMC confirms that it will proceed with the approach to estimating WACC \\nas outlined in the PI Paper . \\n5.2.21  The MCMC confirms its  initial proposal to apply a pre -tax WACC.  \\nQuestion 12:  \\nDo you have any comments on the proposed common parameters to be included in the \\nWACC calculations?  \\n \\n                                           \\n1 Commerce Commission (2019), Fibre regulation emerging views:  Technical Paper , 21 May 2019.

While there are various possible ap proaches \\n(such as introducing changes to affected asset valuations, or using a pure \\nfinancial adjustment), this would introduce further complexity to the model. For \\nexample, in 2020 TM received funding from the NFCP 5 project to migrate \\nexisting copper bro adband subscribers to fibre -optic broadband access networks \\nwithin the UST areas nationwide. As this was a two year project the timing \\noverlaps with the calibration year of the MCMC’s fixed model, hence the impact \\nof the subsidy sho uld be considered if the MCMC were to include an allowance \\nfor USP contributions.  \\n6.2.207  The MCMC has applied the same approach to USP across all models. In reaching \\nits decision on the treatment of USP in the models the MCMC has carefully \\nreviewed USP disburseme nts in relation to individual operators. The MCMC \\nacknowledges that it has relied on historical data to inform its decision, which \\nmay be an imperfect reflection of the future relationship between USP \\ndisbursements and receipts. However, on balance the MCM C decided it was \\nreasonable to assume that over time the USP fund contributions balance out \\nwith USP receipts.  \\nCAPEX  Modelling  \\n6.2.208  The MCMC welcomes the additional data submitted by TM providing information \\nthe FDA in each category. The MCMC reiterates that the submitted data lacks \\nsufficient granularity and explanation. TM expects the MCMC to accept \\nsuggestions for the proportion of FDA for each asset by highlighting that the \\nsuggestions are consiste nt with the submitted top -down cost data. However, \\ndue to t he lack of granularity, a whole range of values for FDA can be consistent \\nwith the top -down data. Therefore, some adjustments are necessary. For \\nexample, TM records do not differentiate between poles and ducts in the Access \\nCW, leading to the assumption th at both assets should have an equal proportion ')]"
